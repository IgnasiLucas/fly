Fly
===

This is a collaboration with Pau Carazo and Zahida Sultanova. They need to genotype
some flies at several loci along the X chromosome. The SNP arrays commercially available
are too expensive, and would only make sense if we had to genotype a very large number
of samples. I want to design a double-digest RAD-seq experiment, and estimate how much
it would be.
